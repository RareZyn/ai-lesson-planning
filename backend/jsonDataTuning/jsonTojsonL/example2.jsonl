Students take notes and fill in their Bubble Map with specific details\\n\\n3. Information Sharing (10 minutes): Group members share their findings and complete a comprehensive Bubble Map together about smart home technology\\n\\n4. Problem-Solving Challenge (12 minutes): Each group receives a different scenario (e.g., 'Design a smart classroom', 'Create an app for elderly people', 'Solve internet connectivity issues in rural areas'). Groups brainstorm solutions using technology\\n\\n5. Solution Presentation (3 minutes per group): Groups present their innovative solutions to the class, explaining how technology can solve real-world problems\", \"postActivity\": \"Teacher facilitates a discussion comparing different group solutions and highlighting creative uses of technology.
