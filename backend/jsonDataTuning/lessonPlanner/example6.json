    "activity": "1. Brainstorming and Planning (8 minutes): Students use Tree Map to organize their invitation ideas:\n   - Essential Information: who they're inviting, what event\n   - Event Details: date, time, location, activities\n   - Personal Touch: why the person should come, what to bring\n\n2. Email Format Review (5 minutes): Teacher reviews email components with class:\n   - Subject line (clear and specific)\n   - Greeting (Dear/Hi + name)\n   - Body paragraphs (purpose + details)\n   - Closing (looking forward to + name)\n\n3. Individual Writing (25 minutes): Students write their email invitations to invite a friend or relative to a family event. They must include:\n   - Clear subject line\n   - Appropriate greeting\n   - Event purpose and details\n   - Personal reasons why the person should attend\n   - Polite closing\n\n4. Self-Editing and Spelling Check (7 minutes): Students review their emails for spelling accuracy, especially high-frequency words, and check email format elements\n\n5. Peer Review Exchange (10 minutes): Students exchange emails with a partner to check for clarity, completeness, and appropriate tone. Partners provide feedback on missing details or unclear information",
    "postActivity": "Teacher selects volunteers to read their email invitations aloud (with permission) and class discusses what made each invitation effective and appealing. Students reflect on which email format elements were most challenging and which family events they would most like to attend based on the invitations heard. Teacher provides feedback on common spelling errors with high-frequency words and reinforces the importance of clear communication in family relationships. Students are assigned to write a thank you email to someone who helped their family recently for homework practice."
