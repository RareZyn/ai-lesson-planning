    "objective": "Students will be able to create comprehensive project presentations analyzing workplace dynamics and financial literacy concepts from the textbook 'A Hard Day's Work', demonstrate mastery of advanced reading strategies to construct meaning from complex texts, utilize print and digital resources for in-depth research, and synthesize textbook content with real-world career and financial planning applications while developing innovative solutions to contemporary workplace challenges.",
    "successCriteria": "Students can design and execute original project work incorporating at least 8 key concepts from the textbook passage about work and financial responsibility, demonstrate sophisticated use of print and digital resources to verify and expand textbook information, create detailed Flow Maps showing the sequential process from education to career success to financial security, present well-researched 15-20 minute project presentations that synthesize textbook content with current workplace trends, and develop innovative proposals for addressing modern workplace and financial literacy challenges based on textbook foundations.",
    "preActivity": "Teacher introduces the topic 'A Hard Day's Work' by presenting current statistics about Malaysian workforce trends, career satisfaction, and financial literacy among young adults. Students examine the textbook unit by analyzing complex vocabulary related to career development, workplace ethics, and financial planning (entrepreneurship, work-life balance, professional development, financial security, career trajectory, etc.). Demonstrate Flow Map structure to show the sequential progression from education through career development to financial independence. Students share their career aspirations and discuss how the textbook content relates to their future planning, identifying gaps between textbook concepts and current workplace realities.",

Peer Collaboration and Resource Sharing (15 minutes): Students collaborate to:\n   - Share valuable resources and research findings\n   - Provide feedback on project development\n   - Cross-reference textbook interpretations\n   - Suggest improvements and additional perspectives\n   - Coordinate complementary project elements to avoid overlap\n\n6. Project Presentation Preparation (10 minutes): Students finalize their presentations ensuring:\n   - Clear connection between textbook content and project outcomes\n   - Professional presentation skills and visual aids\n   - Time management for 15-20 minute presentations\n   - Preparation for questions and discussion\n   - Documentation of all sources used in research\n\n7. Project Presentations and Peer Evaluation (35 minutes): Students present their projects while others:\n   - Evaluate integration of textbook concepts with original research\n   - Assess quality of additional resources and verification\n   - Note innovative solutions and creative applications\n   - Provide constructive feedback on presentation skills\n   - Identify practical applications for their own career planning",
    "postActivity": "Teacher facilitates a comprehensive synthesis session where students identify common themes across all projects and evaluate which presentations most effectively bridged textbook theory with practical application.
