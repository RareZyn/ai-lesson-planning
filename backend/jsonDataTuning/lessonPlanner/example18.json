    "objective": "Students will be able to demonstrate analytical thinking skills through a comprehensive assessment on life lessons and moral values, explain and justify advice based on literary scenarios from poetry, analyze communication strategies in various social contexts, and compare different perspectives on life lessons using Double Bubble Map thinking while showing mastery of speaking and listening skills.",
    "successCriteria": "Students can achieve at least 80% accuracy on the 30-question assessment covering speaking, listening, and grammar skills related to giving advice and life lessons, successfully analyze poetry excerpts to extract moral messages and life lessons, demonstrate understanding of communication strategies through multiple choice and short answer responses, and complete oral assessment components that show ability to explain and justify advice within the allocated 90-minute assessment period.",
    "preActivity": "Teacher reviews the topic 'Lessons to Learn' by discussing various life experiences that teach important lessons (overcoming challenges, learning from mistakes, developing character, etc.). Students review key vocabulary related to advice-giving, moral values, and life lessons (wisdom, experience, guidance, perseverance, resilience, etc.) that will appear in the assessment. Demonstrate Double Bubble Map structure to compare different approaches to learning life lessons and giving advice. Teacher explains the mixed-format assessment including multiple choice questions, short answers, true/false items, and oral components. Students practice analyzing poetry for moral messages and practice giving advice using appropriate language structures.",

    "postActivity": "Teacher conducts individual feedback sessions with students needing additional support in speaking skills or analytical thinking, providing specific strategies for improvement. Students create personal development plans based on assessment results, setting goals for speaking confidence and analytical reasoning skills. Class engages in moral discussion circle where students share life lessons they've learned and advice they would give to younger students. Teacher assigns differentiated activities: speaking practice sessions for students needing oral skill development, and advanced poetry analysis projects for high achievers. Students reflect on how Double Bubble Map thinking helped them compare different perspectives during the assessment and plan to use this strategy for future moral reasoning tasks. Assessment results inform future lesson planning focused on speaking skills development and character education integration."
