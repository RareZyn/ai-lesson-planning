  "Activity": {
    "objective": "Students will be able to analyze cause and effect relationships in environmental texts, extract specific information about natural phenomena, and present their findings on the interconnections between human activities and nature's responses.",
    "successCriteria": "Students can independently identify at least 3 cause-effect relationships from environmental texts, analyze the impact of human actions on nature using Multi-Flow Maps, and deliver a clear 3-minute presentation explaining environmental connections with supporting evidence from the text.",
    "preActivity": "Teacher introduces 'The Wonders of Nature' topic by displaying images of various natural phenomena (coral reefs, rainforests, glaciers, etc.) and asks students to predict what threats these face. Introduce advanced vocabulary related to environmental issues (deforestation, pollution, biodiversity, ecosystem, conservation, etc.). Demonstrate how to use Multi-Flow Map to show multiple causes leading to effects and multiple effects stemming from causes. Set up computer lab with access to environmental articles and presentation software.",
    "activity": "1. Text Distribution (3 minutes): Provide students with complex environmental articles about different natural wonders (Amazon rainforest, Great Barrier Reef, Arctic ice caps, etc.)\n\n2. Independent Reading and Analysis (25 minutes): Students read their assigned articles independently, identifying specific details about environmental threats and natural responses. They create Multi-Flow Maps showing:\n   - Multiple human causes → Environmental effects\n   - Environmental changes → Multiple consequences\n\n3. Digital Presentation Preparation (15 minutes): Students use lab computers to create digital presentations incorporating their Multi-Flow Maps, key statistics from texts, and visual aids\n\n4. Whole Class Presentations (15 minutes): Each student delivers a 3-minute presentation to the entire class, explaining the cause-effect relationships they discovered and proposing solutions\n\n5. Q&A and Discussion (7 minutes): Class engages in questions and discussion after each presentation, analyzing different perspectives on environmental issues",
    "postActivity": "Teacher leads a synthesis discussion connecting all presentations to show how different natural wonders face similar threats from human activities. Students reflect on the most surprising cause-effect relationships they learned and vote on the most compelling solutions presented. Teacher emphasizes reading strategies used for extracting specific information from complex texts and assigns students to find one recent news article about environmental issues for next lesson's discussion."
