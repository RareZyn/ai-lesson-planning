    "objective": "Students will be able to write a guided essay about personal experiences with wildlife and environmental conservation using the three-key-point structure, evaluate the multiple causes and effects of wildlife conservation efforts, connect sentences and paragraphs using sophisticated cohesive devices, and demonstrate advanced writing skills through drafting and revision processes while showing deep understanding of environmental themes.",
    "successCriteria": "Students can compose a well-structured 300-350 word guided essay following the Key Point A, B, and C framework about personal wildlife experiences, demonstrate effective use of advanced cohesive devices (however, furthermore, consequently, meanwhile, etc.) to create seamless paragraph transitions, use Multi-Flow Maps to analyze multiple causes leading to wildlife conservation needs and multiple effects resulting from conservation efforts, and successfully revise their essays based on feedback to improve coherence, environmental accuracy, and persuasive impact.",
    "preActivity": "Teacher introduces the topic 'Wild World' by showcasing diverse wildlife footage and discussing current conservation challenges facing endangered species globally and in Malaysia. Students share personal experiences with wildlife encounters, nature documentaries, or conservation activities they've participated in or witnessed. Introduce sophisticated environmental vocabulary (biodiversity, ecosystem, conservation, habitat destruction, species extinction, sustainable development, etc.). Demonstrate Multi-Flow Map structure to show multiple causes that threaten wildlife (deforestation, pollution, climate change, human encroachment) and multiple effects of successful conservation efforts (species recovery, ecosystem balance, economic benefits, educational value). Present the guided essay structure with Key Points A, B, and C framework for organizing personal wildlife experiences.",
    "activity": "1. Personal Experience Brainstorming and Multi-Flow Analysis (18 minutes): Students identify personal wildlife experiences or environmental observations and create Multi-Flow Maps showing:\n   - Multiple causes: What factors led to their wildlife encounter or environmental awareness\n   - Central experience: Their personal wildlife or nature experience\n   - Multiple effects: How this experience changed their perspective on conservation\n   Students organize their experiences using the three-key-point structure:\n   - Key Point A: The wildlife encounter or environmental experience\n   - Key Point B: What they learned about conservation challenges\n   - Key Point C: How it changed their environmental awareness or behavior\n\n2. Essay Structure Planning and Cohesive Device Selection (15 minutes): Students plan their guided essays using advanced organization:\n   - Introduction: Hook about wildlife importance + personal experience preview + thesis\n   - Body Paragraph 1: Key Point A with detailed description of wildlife experience\n   - Body Paragraph 2: Key Point B analyzing conservation challenges observed\n   - Body Paragraph 3: Key Point C describing personal growth and future actions\n   - Conclusion: Summary of key points + call for conservation action\n   Students select appropriate cohesive devices for each transition\n\n3. Advanced Vocabulary and Environmental Terminology Integration (12 minutes): Students enhance their essay plans by incorporating:\n   - Sophisticated wildlife and conservation vocabulary\n   - Technical terms related to environmental science\n   - Emotive language to convey conservation urgency\n   - Precise descriptive language for wildlife encounters\n   Students ensure accurate use of environmental terminology throughout their essays\n\n4. First Draft Composition (45 minutes): Students write their guided essays focusing on:\n   - Vivid descriptions of personal wildlife experiences using sensory details\n   - Analytical evaluation of conservation challenges using Multi-Flow thinking\n   - Sophisticated cohesive devices to connect ideas across paragraphs\n   - Environmental terminology used accurately and effectively\n   - Personal reflection showing growth in environmental awareness\n   - Persuasive elements encouraging conservation action\n\n5. Cohesive Device Enhancement and Flow Review (15 minutes): Students review their drafts specifically for:\n   - Variety and appropriateness of cohesive devices used\n   - Smooth transitions between key points and paragraphs\n   - Logical progression from personal experience to broader conservation themes\n   - Effective use of reference pronouns and linking words\n\n6. Peer Review and Environmental Accuracy Check (20 minutes): Students exchange essays with partners who evaluate:\n   - Clarity and impact of personal wildlife experiences described\n   - Accuracy of environmental information and conservation concepts\n   - Effectiveness of Multi-Flow cause-and-effect analysis\n   - Quality of cohesive devices and paragraph connections\n   - Persuasive power of conservation arguments\n   - Appropriate use of sophisticated vocabulary\n\n7. Revision and Enhancement Based on Feedback (15 minutes): Students revise their essays focusing on:\n   - Strengthening weak descriptions or environmental analysis\n   - Improving cohesive device usage for better flow\n   - Adding missing environmental details or conservation insights\n   - Enhancing persuasive elements and personal reflection\n   - Correcting any environmental terminology or factual errors",
    "postActivity": "Teacher organizes a 'Conservation Voices' sharing session where students read excerpts from their personal wildlife essays, highlighting how individual experiences connect to broader conservation needs. Class discusses which essays most effectively combined personal narrative with environmental advocacy and which demonstrated the strongest use of cohesive devices. Students reflect on how writing about personal experiences enhanced their understanding of wildlife conservation and identify which aspects of essay writing they found most challenging or rewarding. Teacher highlights excellent examples of sophisticated vocabulary usage and effective cohesive device implementation. Students are assigned to research one endangered species mentioned in class essays and write a brief conservation action plan using similar cohesive device techniques for the next lesson, extending their personal environmental commitment beyond writing."
