  "Activity": {
    "objective": "Students will be able to understand the main points in textbook passages about environmental conservation, identify specific information about keeping the environment clean and green, and demonstrate comprehension through various reading activities while developing awareness of environmental responsibility.",
    "successCriteria": "Students can successfully identify at least 5 main points from the textbook passage about environmental conservation, answer comprehension questions with 80% accuracy, demonstrate understanding of environmental vocabulary through context clues, and organize information about green practices using Tree Map structure with appropriate categorization.",
    "preActivity": "Teacher introduces the topic 'Keep It Green, Keep It Clean' by showing images of clean and polluted environments, asking students to compare and contrast what they observe. Introduce key environmental vocabulary from the textbook unit (pollution, recycling, conservation, environment, waste, renewable, biodiversity, etc.). Display the Tree Map structure to help students organize information about different types of environmental protection (air quality, water conservation, waste management, etc.). Preview the textbook passage by discussing the title, headings, and images to activate prior knowledge about environmental issues.",
    "activity": "1. Pre-Reading Vocabulary Review (8 minutes): Students work with textbook vocabulary list, matching environmental terms with simple definitions and discussing words they already know from their daily experience\n\n2. Guided Reading - First Read (15 minutes): Students read the textbook passage 'Keep It Green, Keep It Clean' silently while teacher guides them to:\n   - Identify main topic sentences in each paragraph\n   - Underline key environmental terms\n   - Note any unfamiliar words for later discussion\n\n3. Comprehension Check - Main Points (12 minutes): Students complete textbook comprehension questions focusing on:\n   - What are the main environmental problems mentioned?\n   - What solutions does the text suggest?\n   - Why is it important to keep our environment clean?\n   Students organize their answers using Tree Map categories\n\n4. Detailed Reading - Second Read (15 minutes): Students re-read specific sections to find detailed information about:\n   - Specific examples of green practices\n   - How individuals can help the environment\n   - Benefits of environmental conservation\n   Students fill in Tree Map with specific details under each main category\n\n5. Textbook Exercise Completion (20 minutes): Students complete the provided textbook exercises which may include:\n   - Multiple choice questions about main ideas\n   - True/false statements about environmental facts\n   - Fill-in-the-blanks using vocabulary from the passage\n   - Short answer questions about green practices\n\n6. Vocabulary in Context Practice (10 minutes): Using textbook examples, students practice understanding environmental vocabulary through context clues, creating simple sentences using new words from the passage\n\n7. Reading Comprehension Discussion (10 minutes): Students discuss their Tree Map findings in pairs, comparing their understanding of main points and sharing which environmental practices they found most interesting or practical",
    "postActivity": "Teacher conducts a whole-class review of the textbook passage main points and checks answers to textbook exercises. Students share their Tree Map categorizations and discuss which environmental practices they can implement in their daily lives and school environment. Teacher emphasizes the connection between reading comprehension skills and real-world environmental awareness. Students reflect on which reading strategies helped them understand the textbook content best. For homework, students are assigned to complete any remaining textbook exercises and find one example of environmental conservation in their community to share in the next lesson."
