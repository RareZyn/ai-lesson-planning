First Draft Writing (30 minutes): Students write their guided essays following the point structure. They must:\n   - Include all three points in logical order\n   - Provide specific examples and details\n   - Write at least two well-developed paragraphs\n   - Use appropriate leisure-related vocabulary\n\n4. Self-Review and Revision (10 minutes): Students review their drafts for:\n   - Clarity of ideas and examples\n   - Paragraph organization and flow\n   - Use of connecting words between points\n   - Spelling and basic grammar\n\n5. Peer Feedback Session (12 minutes): Students exchange drafts with partners who provide feedback using a simple checklist:\n   - Are all three points clearly addressed?\n   - Is the personal experience detailed and interesting?\n   - Are the paragraphs well-organized?\n   - Suggestions for improvement\n\n6. Final Revision (10 minutes): Students modify their essays based on peer feedback, making necessary improvements to content and organization",
    "postActivity": "Teacher facilitates sharing of interesting personal experiences from students' essays (with permission). Class discusses which leisure activities seem most popular and effective for stress relief based on the essays shared. Students reflect on the writing process and identify which of the three points was easiest/hardest to develop. Teacher provides feedback on common strengths and areas for improvement in essay organization and content development. Students are assigned to observe and write about a leisure activity they've never tried before, preparing for next lesson's discussion on exploring new hobbies."
